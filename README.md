# Clock

Write a class that takes a string in the format, "12:34 PM", and returns an integer for the number of degrees between the minute hand and the hour hand of the clock. For example, "3:00 PM" should return 90; "6:00 AM" should return 180. The method should return the smaller degree as there are always 2 possible degree values between the hands, so "9:00 AM" should return 90 instead of 270.

## Quickstart

1. `bundle`
2. `bundle exec guard`
3. `touch app/clock.rb` (in a new terminal)
